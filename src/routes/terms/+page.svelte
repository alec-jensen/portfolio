			of these Terms.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>Limitation of Liability:</em> To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, I shall not
			be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including
			loss of profits, data, or goodwill, resulting from your use of or inability to use the Services.

			you waive any objection to jurisdiction or venue in such courts. Nothing in this section
			limits my ability to seek injunctive or equitable relief in any jurisdiction.
		</p>

			remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.

		<p>
			No Waiver: My failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered
