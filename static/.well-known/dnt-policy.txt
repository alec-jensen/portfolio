Do Not Track Policy

Last updated: 2025-10-20

Scope
This policy applies to web properties served from this domain.

Respect for Do Not Track and GPC
- We treat a browser’s Do Not Track (DNT) setting as a signal of a user preference not to be tracked across sites.
- We also honor Global Privacy Control (GPC) signals.

What “honor” means here
- We do not set or use third‑party tracking cookies.
- We do not sell or share personal information for cross‑context behavioral advertising.
- Our analytics are strictly cookieless and pseudonymous, used only in aggregate to understand traffic and performance.
- We do not fingerprint users for advertising or cross‑site tracking.

Scope limitations
- Necessary security telemetry (e.g., WAF, firewall, abuse prevention) may still be processed to protect the service.
- First‑party functional storage may be used to deliver requested features, but not for cross‑site tracking.
