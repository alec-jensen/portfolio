	<h1><rainbow>About</rainbow> me</h1>

	<p>
		I am Alec Jensen, a software developer from the United States. I have been programming since
		2018, starting with C on an Arduino Uno. I have since learned C++, Python, Java,
		JavaScript, Svelte/SvelteKit, and Astro.
	</p>

	<p>
		I enjoy making cool projects using the technologies I have learned, and learning new ones to do
		even more cool things!
	</p>

	<p>
		Outside of programming, I enjoy playing the viola, flying my drone, and making YouTube videos. I
		also enjoy playing video games, my favorite being Minecraft. I am in the computer science club
		and Roboboat club at my school.
